# 🛡️ Keylogger Software (Interactive GUI)

A **client-side web-based keylogger** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, built for **educational** and **ethical security research** purposes. This project demonstrates how browser-based keylogging can work, helping students and professionals learn how such tools operate and how to protect against them.

> ⚠️ This tool must only be used in ethical, legal, and educational contexts. It is intended for simulations, training, or personal testing—**never use it without consent**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The Keylogger Tool captures keystrokes in real time and logs them to a secure in-memory buffer. It features an interactive UI that allows users to:

- Start or stop logging
- View typed characters live
- Clear the log
- Download the full keystroke log as a `.txt` file

This demonstrates keylogger mechanics used in malware, and why input sanitization and endpoint protection are important in cybersecurity.
